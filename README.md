This is a Database Migrations system for CakePHP.

The plugin consists of a CakePHP CLI wrapper for the [Phinx](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/index.html) migrations library.

This branch is for use with CakePHP **5.x**. See [version map](https://github.com/cakephp/migrations/wiki#version-map) for details.

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Run the following command
```sh
composer require cakephp/migrations
 ```

## Configuration

You can load the plugin using the shell command:

```
bin/cake plugin load Migrations
```

Or you can manually add the loading statement in the **src/Application.php** file of your application:

```php
public function bootstrap(): void
{
    parent::bootstrap();
    $this->addPlugin('Migrations');
}
```

### Enabling the builtin backend

In a future release migrations will be switching to a new backend based on the CakePHP ORM. We're aiming
to be compatible with as many existing migrations as possible, and could use your feedback. Enable the
new backend with:

```php
// in app/config/app_local.php
$config = [
    // Other configuration
    'Migrations' => ['backend' => 'builtin'],
];

```

## Documentation

Full documentation of the plugin can be found on the [CakePHP Cookbook](https://book.cakephp.org/migrations/4/).
